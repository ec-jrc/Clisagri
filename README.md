Clisagri is based on a set of dynamic agro-climatic indicators that bring key information to crop producers during different stages of the crop growth. A hybrid approach has been implemented to assess the risks associated with climate extremes occurring during sensitive crop phenological stages by integrating dedicated agro-climate risk indicators with a dynamic model to predict crop phenology. Clisagri quantifies the occurrence of different climatic extremes such as drought, excessive wetness, heat stress and cold stress during sensitive crop growth stages. These sensitive phases generally occur in different periods every year as a consequence of inter-annual climate variability and Clisagri offers an effective way to dynamically take this variability into account.

Furthermore, Clisagri is designed to test a complete range of possible crop varieties, and an optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm has been implemented to select the variety that is 'the most fit' for given climatic conditions.
